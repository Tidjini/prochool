### Problems

Browser can hide you from resources from a different domain, (you can use just your domain or sub)
Cross-Origin Resources Sharing come to rescue

- Access-Control-Allow-Origin: to allow the use of our resources
- Access-Control-Allow-Headers: to allow the send requests with specifics headers
- Access-Control-Allow-Creadentials | 'true': to allow cockies
